Escape is a game that challenges players to use a variety of skills in order to set an innocent person free from prison. The game consists of five puzzle-based locks that must be solved in order to progress through the levels and ultimately free the prisoner.


One of the key soft skills that the game assesses indirectly is reflexes. In the first puzzle, players must be observant in order to spot the trojans with his/her reflexes. Additionally, they must be quick on their feet in order to respond to the challenges that the puzzle presents.

The second puzzle focuses on math and quantitative thinking. Players must use their numerical skills to solve the lock and progress to the next stage.

Imagination and arrangement are tested in the third puzzle. Players must use their creativity to come up with solutions that will allow them to progress through the level. They must also be able to arrange various objects in a way that will help them solve the puzzle.

The fourth puzzle tests general knowledge and combinations. Players must use their knowledge of a wide range of subjects in order to solve the lock. Additionally, they must be able to combine different pieces of information in order to arrive at the correct solution.

The fifth and final puzzle focuses on natural intuition and guessing. Players must rely on their instincts and intuition in order to solve the lock. They must also be able to take calculated risks in order to progress through the game.
